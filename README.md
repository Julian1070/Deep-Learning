# Deep Learning
This repository holds some deep learning projects I have worked on in class.

## Neural Network from scratch with numpy
I built a neural network from scratch using only numpy and trained it on the dataset from the famous Titanic challenge on Kaggle. Here is the submission:\n

## GAN generating flag icons
With the help of diegoalejogm's implementation of a Vanilla GAN generating hand-written digits (https://github.com/diegoalejogm/gans/blob/master/1.%20Vanilla%20GAN%20PyTorch.ipynb), I used a dataset of small flag icons from flagpedia (http://flagpedia.net/download) to generate small black and white flag icons.
